            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a software engineer with experience in robotics
                and simulation projects. I've worked independently
                and in teams on numerous projects. I also have solid 
                research and managerial experience. In my free time, I 
                enjoy learning about robotics topics that interest me 
                like vision language models, 3D printing, and physics.
                I also enjoy singing in choirs and biking.</p>
