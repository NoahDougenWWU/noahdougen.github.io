                    <h2>Drone Object Tracking with Aruco Tags</h2>
                    <!--<img src="images/warehouse_bot.jpg" alt="Warehouse Robot" />-->
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>A team of four people worked together to create object 
                    tracking software for the Crazyflie 2.1 minidrone. Our
                    software uses Aruco tags to track the positions of the drone 
                    and a target object. The drone can then be controlled by moving
                    the target object.</p>
                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Object tracking and state estimation</li>
                        <li>Experience with libraries like OpenCV</li>
                        <li>Collaborative project experience</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Details</h3>
                    <p>Our team setup a system that allowed a Crazyflie drone to be
                        controlled using two Aruco tags, one attahced to the drone
                        and one attached to a target object. The system involved a 
                        camera scanning for the two Aruco tags, estimating both their
                        positions, and instructing the drone to remain close to the 
                        target object with PID controllers. The system mainly utilizes 
                        OpenCV's Aruco tag library for position estimation.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Sense-Think-Act Loop</h4>
                    <p>The system starts with the stationary camera scanning for the two
                        Aruco tags and the drone taking off and hovering. The states (xyz positions)
                        are estimated using known information about the tag size and camera. 
                        To create accurate estimates of the drone and target's states the ten most
                        recent states are averaged together. This reduces error from the 
                        occasional misread caused by glare.
                    </p>
                    <p>With positions estimated, the drone can be commanded to move up/down, 
                        backward/forward, and left/right. To control this, we developed three 
                        PID controllers, one for each xyz coordinate. An offset is used to keep 
                        drone slightly lower than the target so both Aruco tags can be read by
                        the camera. The action commands are given in real-time once every tenth
                        of a second.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Kalman Filtering</h4>
                    <p>While it was unecessary to implement into the final system, I also
                        developed a kalman filtering algorithm for estimating the position, rotation,
                        and velocity of an Aruco tag. This would be ideal for situations where 
                        the tag became obscured for a few seconds as it would aloow the system 
                        to predict the tag's state. Below is a GIF demonstrating the algorithm.
                        The tag that trails behind the tag is the estimated state.
