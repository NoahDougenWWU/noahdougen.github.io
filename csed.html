                    <!--<img src="images/warehouse_bot.jpg" alt="Warehouse Robot" />-->
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>As a research assitant, I worked with a team spanning multiple
                       universities to study the CS teacher pipeline. Specifically, we
                       examined the barriers and challenges developers of pre-service 
                       and in-service teacher preparation programs face when designing
                       and implementing their programs. We conducted 23 interviews and 
                       submitted a 30 page paper to the Computer Science Education journal.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Second author on a multi-year long study</li>
                        <li>Experience with research design and execution</li>
                        <li>Extensive writing, analysis, and collaborative experience</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Details</h3>
                    <p>While there is an increasing demand for computer science 
                        education, many schools don't have and can't find CS teachers.
                        One reason for this is the sputtering state of the computer science 
                        teacher preparation pipeline. Quite a few CS teacher preparation 
                        programs have been initiated over the last 15 years, however the 
                        vast majority have consistently struggled to certify more than a 
                        handful of teachers per year. This research was conducted to
                        examine these programs through Kotter's framework of organizational 
                        change. We conducted 23 interviews with program leaders to identify 
                        the barriers they faced and the strategies they used during program 
                        development and sustainment. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We found a number of substantial barriers, 
                        including ill-fitting state policies, institutional hurdles, and a 
                        lack of computer science teacher preparation resources. These barriers 
                        often compound each other and ultimately, programs that had trouble 
                        establishing the first four steps of Kotter's framework during the 
                        program development stage are highly likely to have trouble accomplishing 
                        the last four during the sustainment phase.
