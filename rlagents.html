                    <h2>Simulating Classroom Agents with Reinforcement Learning</h2>
                    <!--<img src="images/warehouse_bot.jpg" alt="Warehouse Robot" />-->
                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>The main research experience for my Master's program was the 
                        creation and study of a classroom simulation. Under the 
                        supervision of a research advisor, I used Unity's rl-agents 
                        platform to design and optimize student agents with realistic
                        behavior. This research was designed and completed independently.
                        This paper was submitted to the 2025 IEEE Computer Software and 
                        Applications Conference.

                    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trained a Soft-actor critic network for a simulation task</li>
                        <li>Experience with simulation software and deep learning techniques</li>
                        <li>Individual research experience</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Details</h3>
                    <p>Current popular methods for creating realistic autonomous 
                        human agents require complex rule sets and expertise,
                        especially when considering Multi-Agent environments. This
                        study examined the use of reinforcement learning for this task.
                        By designing agents meant to take advantage of reinforcement
                        learning theory, namely the idea of Markov Games, five soft-
                        actor critic reinforcement learning models were trained on the
                        task of simulating student agents with unique personalities
                        in a classroom. Agent performance was evaluated quantitatively
                        through the use of a behavior flagging system. The results
                        demonstrated that reinforcement learning is a viable approach
                        for creating autonomous human agents that demonstrate complex
                        behavior.
